<h1 class="entry-title">What Is DevOps?</h1>
	<div class="entry entry-content">
		<p><b>DevOps is a term for a group of concepts that, while not all new, have catalyzed into a movement and are rapidly spreading throughout the technical community.  Like any new and popular term, people have somewhat confused and sometimes contradictory impressions of what it is.  Here&#8217;s my take on how DevOps can be usefully defined; I propose this definition as a standard framework to more clearly discuss the various issues DevOps covers. Like &#8220;Quality&#8221; or &#8220;Agile,&#8221; DevOps is a large enough concept that it requires some nuance to fully understand.</b></p>
<h2>Definition of DevOps</h2>
<p><b>DevOps is a new term emerging from the collision of two major related trends. The first was also called &#8220;agile system administration&#8221; or &#8220;agile operations&#8221;; it sprang from applying newer Agile and Lean approaches to operations work.  The second is a much expanded understanding of the value of collaboration between development and operations staff throughout all stages of the development lifecycle when creating and operating a service, and how important operations has become in our increasingly service-oriented world (cf. <a href="http://devopsjourney.com/">Operations: The New Secret Sauce</a>).</b></p>
